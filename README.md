## Multiple Linear regression for Bike Sharing demand
> This project is to build a multiple linear regression model for the prediction of demand for shared bikes.


## Description of the Project
A bike-sharing system is a service in which bikes are made available for shared use to individuals on a short term basis for a price or free. 
A US bike-sharing provider BoomBikes has recently suffered considerable dips in their revenues due to the ongoing Corona pandemic. The company is finding it very difficult to sustain in the current market scenario. So, it has decided to come up with a mindful business plan to be able to accelerate its revenue as soon as the ongoing lockdown comes to an end, and the economy restores to a healthy state. 

In such an attempt, BoomBikes aspires to understand the demand for shared bikes among the people after this ongoing quarantine situation ends across the nation due to Covid-19. They have planned this to prepare themselves to cater to the people's needs once the situation gets better all around and stand out from other service providers and make huge profits.
In this Project, we will use EDA and Linear Regression to understand which variables can be used to explain the demand of the rental bikes. Also, how well they can explain the demand


For the above objective we have a day dataset and a data dictionary

## We have performed below steps for this project.
1. Data understanding
2. Data Cleaning (Missing values treatment, outlier treatment etc)
3. Univariate analysis
4. Bivariate analysis
5. Splitting the data in train-test
6. Rescaling the features
7. Select the features using RFE
8. Run the model
9. Drop the redundant variables and again run the model until a satisfcatory model equation comes up
10. Check for linear regression assumptions
11. Evaluate the model by running it on test data
12. Calculate the R2 on the test data
